// Introduction

const Intro = "Hi there! I am Laurence Garcia, a newly graduated Computer Science major from Cal Poly Pomona. I recently interned at Nickelodeon Animation Studios, where I developed production-enhancing tools that help assist the various teams. I was also the President and Secretary of the CPP Game Development Club, where I brought together a community of students to learn more about the game development industry, through guest speakers and club projects. I am expanding my skills in programming languages and frameworks, such as Java, C#, Python, React, and many more. My goal is to continue growing my skill set in the fields of Software Engineering, Game Development, and Tech Art."
