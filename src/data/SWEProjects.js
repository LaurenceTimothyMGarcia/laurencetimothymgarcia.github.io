Within an environment, users use an in-game controller to fly the drone and can swap into the drone's perspective. The user has the choice to pick the time of day and weather conditions which will also impact the drone's physics, when flying. The software also includes an 'exam' feature which tests the user on flight regulation questions based on California's drone license exams from previous years. ",
