Design Analysis of DPS Idle

Introduction
    DPS Idle is a free to play idle game where your character explores a dungeon, defeating enemies, and unlocks cards to defeat stronger enemies. While 
being a very simple game on the surface, there are multiple components to this game that makes it an addicting time for players to enjoy.

Gameplay Loop
    DPS Idle features both a core gameplay loop with its monsters, cards, and dungeon system, and an outer gameplay loop with its guild and hero systems. 
With its core gameplay loop, the player starts off with defeating the first monster, from there they receive gold to buy a random card. The random card 
has a property that will deal damage to the monster, help boost damage of other cards, or earn more gold. From here the player defeats more monsters, with 
each type of monster being worth more gold and more hit points, which earns the player more gold to buy more cards and the gameplay loops itself. When a 
player unlocks all the cards in a deck, they have the option to upgrade one of those cards to a silver card, which will unlock that card for the rest of 
the round and increase the effects of that card, but it will place all the other cards back into the deck. 
    The outer gameplay loop of DPS Idle occurs when the player has enough gold to join a guild. Joining a guild provides a multiplier for a specific stat 
that grows as the current run goes on. Within the time played, only 2 guilds were able to be joined, the merchant guild and the mercenary guild, which 
multiplies the gold income and damage per second respectively. The player has the option to stay in the guild for more benefits for their current run, such 
as free unlocks for their cards and instant kills on specific monsters. However, the player also has the option to leave the guild. Upon leaving the guild, 
they can start a new run, but with the benefit of the multiplier they received and grew from the previous run. This allows the player to start fresh but get 
further into the dungeon at a faster pace, creating the outer gameplay loop.

Space, Objects w/ Attributes, Actions
    Being an idle game, the space is primarily focused on the game screen and the UI elements for the different menus. The center of the screen has the monster 
with its hit points, amount of gold it was worth, and depending on the monster another currency with the percentage of obtaining that currency on defeat. 
The other parts of the screen are taken up by UI elements showing either the cards the player has unlocked or the spheres of magic, where if the player clicks 
on them a specific amount of times, a damage multiplier will be applied to the cards. There are also other screens that allow for more upgrades such as the Guild 
and Heroes System.
    There are various objects in the game that impact the gameplay systems. The main object, the player, has gold, leafs, cards, silver blue coins, skulls, and 
total DPS which correlates to the cards. The cards themselves have a deck they belong to, a color indicating their “level”, and a function, whether they deal 
damage, give more gold, or boost other cards. The monsters have hit points and the gold they are worth upon defeating them, and some monsters also have another 
currency they drop by chance. Chests by cards of a specific deck and have a cost that increases with each purchase. Guilds have a multiplier that grows as the 
run continues, and upgrades and bonuses that apply to the current run. Heroes feature upgrades that also apply to the current run and to future runs. Finally 
there are achievements and quests that can unlock gems, which are the premium currency of the game.
    With the space and objects, the player has multiple actions they can take. The most basic action is clicking on the monster to deal damage, but this quickly 
becomes irrelevant as the click (until the hero upgrades) just stays at 1 damage per click. The player can use the gold to open chests to obtain a random card in 
the deck, with the chest price increasing after each purchase. They can also click on the spheres of magic to add a damage multiplier to the player. Additionally 
they can use a leaf or silver blue coin to enhance a random card. They can join a guild to have a multiplier build up overtime and leave that guild to restart the 
game but with the multiplier applied to their next run. They can also choose a hero after meeting a certain criteria such as having 8 silver cards. It should be 
noted that they can also go to the shop to use real money to buy gems for effects that last between runs.
